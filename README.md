# LatestMovies Application   [![CI](https://github.com/devmanishpatole/LatestMovies/actions/workflows/movies.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/devmanishpatole/LatestMovies/actions/workflows/movies.yml)


**LatestMovies** is a sample Android application, built to demonstrate use of *Modern Android development* tools.



## About
Application loads **Movies** data from [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) and displays in a list format.
The user can tap on the movie which opens the next screen where users can see total like percentage, release date and overview.
The application supports the lazy loading of movies so users can have a seamless data loading experience. Users can also search a movie.

## Features  

The codebase focuses on following key things:

- [x] Single Activity Design
- [x] Clean and Simple Material UI ðŸŽ¨
- [x] Jetpack Compose UI
- [x] Tests

## Architecture
This app uses [***MVVM (Model View View-Model)***](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide#recommended-app-arch) architecture.

The philosophy behind this architecture is to enable separation of concerns and ultimately a very modular application.
This architecture was chosen because it provides the opportunity to separate concerns and implement "SOLID" principles which makes the application more robust and the code base scalable and maintainable.

This due separation of moving parts makes the app more testable with unit tests.


## Quality
- [LeakCanary](https://square.github.io/leakcanary/) - LeakCanary is a memory leak detection library for Android.

## Static code analysis
Used [Sonar Lint](https://www.sonarlint.org/) static code analysis.
